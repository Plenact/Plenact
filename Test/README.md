# Plenact Tests

This directory contains the active unit-test target for Plenact

## Current Coverage

`ChecklistMigrationTests.swift` verifies revision 0 string and card-member migration, stable registered-user assignee round trips, repeatable migration IDs, rich action round trips, the Monday-through-Sunday starter-board contract, and linked-card/Action Detail coverage for every seeded activity card

`LocalProfileStoreTests.swift` verifies isolated local profile persistence, removal, personalization, and avatar initials without reading production preferences

`PlenactBoardDocumentTests.swift` also verifies overlapping database activity, persistent error feedback, ordered background Board saves, preservation of unreadable saved data, and API activity cleanup after success, timeout, and cancellation. Persistence tests use isolated UserDefaults suites; API tests intercept synthetic requests without contacting a server.

## Running Tests

Use the shared `Plenact` scheme with an installed iPhone simulator:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Plenact.xcodeproj -scheme Plenact \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' test
```

Discover locally installed destinations with `xcodebuild -showdestinations -project Plenact.xcodeproj -scheme Plenact`

Keep persistence fixtures focused on compatibility contracts. Do not use real customer, health, or private board data in tests
